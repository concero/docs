# Infrastructure Overview

## Layer breakdown

The user-facing cross-chain infrastructure of Concero can be split into three parts:

### Single-chain Execution Layer
Responsible for executing single-chain transactions on both the source and destination chains. Performs swaps on Decentralised Exchanges and obtains bridgeable tokens in cases of cross-chain transactions.

### Cross-chain Execution Layer
Fast-tracks the cross-chain asset migration by utilising liquidity in the Cross-Chain Pool Infrastructure. Releases the transaction on the destination chain, while its settlement is in progress.

### Settlement layer
Performs value transfer across two chains. Settles the transaction within 30 minutes by repaying the optimistic loan taken by the execution layer.
